# Mini Sorting Machine
## Sorting Objects using a Raspberry Pi and On-Device Machine Learning
This is a robotics project that sorts different objects using a machine learning model from Google Teachable Machine and input from a small camera. It features an automatic feeding system that continuously drops balls down a spiral, where they are then sorted. This prototype uses a High-Torque DC motor to dispense small plastic balls and has a Raspberry Pi V2 Camera mounted on the side. The pictures are fed into the machine learning model and the machine sorts the objects by signaling the 2 mounted servo motors.

This repository contains the source code used to run the smart door project. This project is one of the projects involved in the NSF iTest program where it is demonstrated to k-12 students, so it is an educational project. 

The following equipment is used in this project:
1. 4GB Raspberry Pi 4
2. Coral USB Accelerator
3. Raspberry Pi Camera V2
4. NEMA 17 Stepper Motor
5. DRV8825 Stepper Motor Driver Chip

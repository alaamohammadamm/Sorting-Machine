# Mini Sorting Machine
## Sorting Objects using a Raspberry Pi and On-Device Machine Learning
This robotics project focuses on building a device that sorts different objects using a machine-learning model from Google Teachable Machine and input from a small camera. It features an automatic feeding system that continuously drops balls down a spiral, where they are then sorted. This prototype uses a High-Torque DC motor to dispense small plastic balls and has a Raspberry Pi V2 Camera mounted on the side. The pictures are fed into a machine-learning model and the machine sorts the objects by signaling the 2 mounted servo motors.

This repository contains the source code used to run the smart door project. This project is one of the projects involved in the NSF-funded iTest SmartCT program, where it is used to demonstrate the power of machine-learning to K-12 students.

### Equipment:
1. 4GB Raspberry Pi 4
2. Coral USB Accelerator
3. Raspberry Pi Camera V2
4. 2x SG90 Servo Motors

# Sorting Machine
A robotics project that sorts different objects using a machine learning model from Google Teachable Machine and camera input from a small camera, and it has an automatic feeding system that continuosuly drops balls down a spiral. This prototype uses a High-Torque DC motor to dispense the balls and has a Raspberry Pi V2 Camera mounted to the side. The pictures are fed into the machine learning model and performs a corresponding movement by signaling the 2 mounted servo motors - we are using sg90 servo motors. 

## Overview
This repository contains the source code used to run the smart door project. This project is one of the projects involved in the NSF iTest program where it is demonstrated to k-12 students, so it is an educational project. 

This project uses the following:
1. 4GB Raspberry Pi 4
2. Coral USB Accelartor
3. Raspberry Pi V2 Camera
4. NEMA 17 Stepper Motor
5. DRV8825 Stepper Motor Driver Chip
